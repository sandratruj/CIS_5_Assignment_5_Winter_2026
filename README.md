Building with Structures

Goal: Fill out the menu -> the functions at the bottom to complete the menu!

Scenario: You are a professor that is in charge of a class and you want to find a way to organize / manage the class to make life easier on you. 

Tasks:

1. Fill out the ``highestGrade()`` function
2. Fill out the ``lowestGrade()`` function
3. Fill out the ``averageGrade()`` function
4. Fill out the ``printStudentId()`` function
5. Fill out the ``printStudentName()`` function

In main():
- Create 5 different students from the ``Student`` struct
- Go through the menu and make sure when you select all the options, the appropriate responses are displayed. 

Deliverable:
- main.cpp
- 1–2 min video explaining logic + demo run
- Upload to GitHub (fork this repo first)

Reminder: 
I am not only grading for completion but for understanding as well, if you are unable to explain what your code does, even if you have a working solution, I won't be able to give you full points / assumed you just used AI to comeplete the assignment for you.
